// what is time complexity?

    // in every interview after writing your code you will be asked what is the time complexity of the program and what is the space complexity of it

    //  Time complexity !== time taken


    // old widnows              // new macbook


    //  okay here, if we have 10{input} macbook can take 1 sec and windows can take 2 sec
    // input 20 - macbook 2 sek windows 4 sec
    // here time complexity is the rat between the increasing time takens. 
    
    // TC -> BigO notation
    // every types of code takes time in terms of big O notation
    // O() it is expressed like this

    // ex  

    for(var i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
        console.log(i);
    }

    // first step is initializing
    // second step is comparising
    // third step is consoling
    // fourth is increment
    // again comparing fifth
    // again consoling six
    // seven increment 


    // all steps  will be written inside of Big O()
    // time complexity is computed in worst case scenario 8:43
