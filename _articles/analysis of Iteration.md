For Loop in programming 

Inside the for loop, we use a loop variable to control the loop execution, where the initial value of variable decides the starting point. So, we start by initializing the loop variable to some value and checking whether the loop condition is true or not. If the loop condition is true, code inside the loop body will execute. After this loop, execution will move to the next iteration by incrementing or decrementing the loop variable. This step will be repeated till the loop condition becomes false.

```
    for (loop initialisation; loop condition; loop update)
    {
        loop body
    }


```

While Loop

The while loop is used to execute the loop body until a specific condition is false. We mainly apply this idea when we donâ€™t know how many times the loop will execute.

The while loop consists of a loop condition, a block of code as a loop body, and a loop update expression if required. First, the loop condition is evaluated, and if it is true, code within the loop body will be executed. This process repeats until the loop condition becomes false. For better intuition, while loop can be thought of as a repeating if statement.

```

    loop initialisation
   while (loop condition)
   { 
       loop body
       loop update
   }

```
